Simple Keylogger

WHAT IS A KEYLOGGER?
According to TechTarget, a keylogger or a keystroke logger, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke on a specific device, such as a computer or smartphone that can be either hardware- or software-based. 

USES OF KEYLOGGERS
Ethical Use
>By employers to observe employees' computer activities.
>By parents to supervise their children's internet usage.
>By device owners to track possible unauthorized activity on their devices.
>By law enforcement agencies to analyze incidents involving computer use.
>In educational environments to understand cybersecurity threats

Unethical Use
>Cybercriminals use it as a spyware to steal personally identifiable information, login credentials and sensitive enterprise data.

HOW KEYLOGGERS ARE USED
A hardware keylogger can be in the form of a module installed inside the keyboard itself. When the user types on the keyboard, the keylogger collects each keystroke and saves it as text stored on its own hard drive, which can have a memory capacity up to several gigabytes. A common software keylogger consists of two files that get installed in the same directory: a dynamic link library file that does the recording, and an executable file that installs the DLL file and triggers it. The keylogger program records each keystroke the user types and periodically uploads the information over the internet, where the hacker can then access it.

HOW TO IDENTIFY KEYLOGGERS
1. An anti-keylogger
2. Implementing a network monitor

PROTECTION AGAINST KEYLOGGERS
1. Biometrics (Face scan, Iris scan, fingerprint scan)
2. Password managers for autofill
3. One Time Pin (OTP)
4. Firewalls
